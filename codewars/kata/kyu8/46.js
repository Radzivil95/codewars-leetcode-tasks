/*
For a pole vaulter, it is very important to begin the approach run at the best possible starting mark. This is affected by numerous factors and requires fine-tuning in practice. But there is a guideline that will help a beginning vaulter start at approximately the right location for the so-called "three-step approach," based on the vaulter's body height.

This guideline was taught to me in feet and inches, but due to the international nature of Codewars, I am creating this kata to use metric units instead.

You are given the following two guidelines to begin with: (1) A vaulter with a height of 1.52 meters should start at 9.45 meters on the runway. (2) A vaulter with a height of 1.83 meters should start at 10.67 meters on the runway.

You will receive a vaulter's height in meters (which will always lie in a range between a minimum of 1.22 meters and a maximum of 2.13 meters). Your job is to return the best starting mark in meters, rounded to two decimal places.

Hint: Based on the two guidelines given above, you will want to account for the change in starting mark per change in body height. This involves a linear relationship. (If you're not clear on that, search online for "linear equation.") But there is also a constant offset involved. If you can determine the rate of change described above, you should be able to determine that constant offset.

function startingMark(bodyHeight){
  const height1 = 1.52;
  const mark1 = 9.45;
  const height2 = 1.83;
  const mark2 = 10.67;

  const slope = (mark2 - mark1) / (height2 - height1);

  const intercept = mark1 - slope * height1;

  const startingMark = slope * bodyHeight + intercept;

  return Math.round(startingMark * 100) / 100;
}

console.log(startingMark(2.13));


// Test.assertEquals(startingMark(1.22), 8.27)
// Test.assertEquals(startingMark(2.13), 11.85)
